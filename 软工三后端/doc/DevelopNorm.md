# Develop Norm

## Basic

All develop work are based on `dev` branches, from which new branches are derived and later merged back to.  
The `master(main)` branch is updated per week to present runnable demo without providing any guarantee.  
Maybe existing `release` branch contains iteration production with full functionality expected.
